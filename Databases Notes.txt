==========Introduction to Databases=========

DMBS - Database Management System

Concurrency Control -

Physical Data Independence - The way the data is laid on the disk is independent.

High Level Languages have a declarative syntax.

Reliability  - 99.99999%

Data Model: How the data is structured.

Schema vs Data

DDL - Data Definition Language

DML - Data Manipulation Language

SQL - Structured Query Language

A Database is composed of relations or tables

Relation Algebra Query

πid Τgpa > 3.7 ^ (Name = 'Stanford')

Select Student.ID From Student, Apply Where Student.ID=Apply.ID AND GPA>3.7 and college='Stanford'

XML = Extensible Markup Language

=========Relational Database vs XML=========

Structure
  A relational model has a series of tables. XML has a hierarchical structure.

Schema
  In Relational systems the schema is predefined. XML is flexible and self describing.

Ordering
  The Relational System has no ordering. XML has an implied ordering.

============

============DTDs===========

DTDs: Document Type Descriptors, a form of validating XMLs.

Example of a DTR
  <!ELEMENT Book (Title, Authors, Remark?)>

CDATA describes numbers while PCDATA describes text.

The order in which elements appear on the DTD matters and the XML must be conformed to it.

==========XSD - XML Schema Definition============

XSD is written in XML.

==============JSON==============

Json is more appropriate to semi-structured data.

JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is Recursive, it can be called from within itself.

Arrays have lists of values.
Objects are enclosed in {} and are composed of label value relationships, often called properties.

JSON is used in NoSQL systems.


==========SQL============

Pronounced "Sequel"

Select A1, A2, ..., An
From R1, R2, ..., Rm
Where condition

The DISTINCT command removes duplicate results.

where major like '%bio%' will find all entries with the 'bio' keyword.

=========Union, Intersect and Except==========

Union gets the Two Groups, Female and Brazilian

Intersect Gets the Intersection of Two Groups, ie, people who are Female and Brazilian

Except gets everything BUT the specified query.

============Table Relations==========

select Student.ID, sName, GPA, Apply.Name, enrollment
from Student S, College C, Apply A                      S, C  and A are variables
Where A.ID = S.ID and A.Name = C.Name;

==========Subqueries===========

Subqueries are nested SELECT statements.

In sequel the != operator is written like such:

  where S2.Name <> S1.Name

A subquery must always return a single value or a tuple.

========DISTINCT==============

Finds only unique entries

  select count(distinct ID)

In SQL a "variable" is called a relation, it is declared with "as"

========RELATION===========

We must specify what relation two tables have:

  select Name, major, GPA
  from Student, Apply
  where Student.ID = Apply.ID
  order by Name, major;

==========INSERT==============

A Tautology is the saying of the same true thing twice in different ways.

insert into College values ('York University', 'ON')

========COMMUTATIVITY AND ASSOCIATIVITY========

Commutativity (A operation B) = (B operation A)
Associativity (A operation B) operation C = A operation

=========UML===========

RDBMS - Relational Database Management System

5 Concepts

Classes
Associations
Association Classes
Subclasses
Composition & Aggregation

Associations for an item are always on the other side.

STUDENTS 20.000 ------------> 1..5 COLLEGES

Association Class

Indexes

Indexes are the primary way to increase speeds in Databases.

Indexes are build either with Balanced Trees or Hash tables.

Many Databases automatically build indexes based on a Primary Key or Unique attributes.

=========TRANSACTIONS=========

Concurrent transactions

A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a unit.


==========ACID=============

Atomicity: Every transaction is executed all or nothing.
Consistency:
Isolation:
Durability:

========Dirty Read==========

Data written by an uncommitted transaction

===========Triggers===========

Enrollment > 35.000 -> Reject all Applicants

============Referential Integrity===============

Restrict the allowable data and make sure data is properly contained in all tables

Tables must be dropped bottom to top in terms of hierarchy. 

Cascading is the act of deleting a tuple from several joined tables.

create table College(Name text, sate text, enrollment in, primary key (Name, state));

Creating a table with a foreign key

create table College primary key name;
create table Student primary key ID;

  create table Apply(ID int references Student(ID)),
  Name text references College(Name),
