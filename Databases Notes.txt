==========Introduction to Databases=========

DMBS - Database Management System

Concurrency Control -

Physical Data Independence - The way the data is laid on the disk is independent.

High Level Languages have a declarative syntax.

Reliability  - 99.99999%

Data Model: How the data is structured.

Schema vs Data

DDL - Data Definition Language

DML - Data Manipulation Language

SQL - Structured Query Language

A Database is composed of relations or tables

Relation Algebra Query

πid Τgpa > 3.7 ^ (Name = 'Stanford')

Select Student.ID From Student, Apply Where Student.ID=Apply.ID AND GPA>3.7 and college='Stanford'

XML = Extensible Markup Language

=========Relational Database vs XML=========

Structure
  A relational model has a series of tables. XML has a hierarchical structure.

Schema
  In Relational systems the schema is predefined. XML is flexible and self describing.

Ordering
  The Relational System has no ordering. XML has an implied ordering.

============

============DTDs===========

DTDs: Document Type Descriptors, a form of validating XMLs.

Example of a DTR
  <!ELEMENT Book (Title, Authors, Remark?)>

CDATA describes numbers while PCDATA describes text.

The order in which elements appear on the DTD matters and the XML must be conformed to it.

==========XSD - XML Schema Definition============

XSD is written in XML.

==============JSON==============

Json is more appropriate to semi-structured data.

JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is Recursive, it can be called from within itself.

Arrays have lists of values.
Objects are enclosed in {} and are composed of label value relationships, often called properties.

JSON is used in NoSQL systems.


==========SQL============

Pronounced "Sequel"

Select A1, A2, ..., An
From R1, R2, ..., Rm
Where condition

The DISTINCT command removes duplicate results.

where major like '%bio%' will find all entries with the 'bio' keyword.

Union, Intersect and Except operators

============Table Variables==========

select Student.ID, sName, GPA, Apply.Name, enrollment
from Student S, College C, Apply A                      S, C  and A are variables
Where A.ID = S.ID and A.Name = C.Name;
