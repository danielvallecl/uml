========== LESSON 1 ==========

Bibliography:

Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, Martin Fowler

Domain is the field which is being worked on.

Domain Model

  Structured Languages and OO Languages have different diagram systems.

Domain Model Abstraction Level: Conceptual, Logic, Design

Conceptual Analysis - Discovers business requirements and their relations regardless of what system is used.

System Analyst describes the relationships and entities but still regardless of Programming Paradigm or Technology.

Project Director describes the entities but tied to a Programming Paradigm

A Class has a Name, Attributes and Methods/Services, which are the actions the Class takes

Analysis described the PROBLEM, Design describes the SOLUTION.

Unified Process

Normalization is a way of Standardizing procedures

========== LESSON 2 ==========

Attributes

  Should not have multivalues
  Cannot be composed of several attributes, like a long form address

At the Conceptual Model Classes don't have Methods described yet.

<<unique>> identifies which attributes are unique

Derived Attributes are attributes that depend on previous ones like such:

-Price
-Coupon
-Final Price = Price - Coupon


=========== LESSON 3 ===========

System Requirements

Use cases

A structured document that specifies the trade of information between the systems.

Specifies interactions between the System Actors.

Concepts are always nouns. User, Purchase, Payment, etc.

=========== LESSON 4 ===========

At the UML stage each concept is called a CONCEPT.

Camelcase is used for attribute names in UML

=========== LESSON 5 ===========

Instances of Objects

Associations are made with a line with ROLE under it and the value, called MULTIPLICITY on top of it.

MULTIPLICITY has a minimum and maximum value

The person can have 0 up to unlimited cars
Person 1<------------------------- 0..* Car

A person can drive many cars
Person 1>>* <-------------------- 0..* Eyes

0, 2, 5 (Zero or Two or Five)

ASSOCIATIONS

Dependency Relationship; a user has many cars and once deleted the cars must also go or be reassigned.

A dotted line shows that a Concept is dependent on another

If on one side 1 is required, the other side is dependent on it.

AUTOASSOCIATIONS

A user can follow many users and can be followed by many users.




Associations: One to Many
